    <p class="wushu">
      Wushu refers to the several hundred styles of Chinese martial arts developed over centuries in China. The term serves as a blanket term for all the Chinese martial arts (kung fu is often erroneously used as a blanket term, but kung fu is actually a specific style of wushu resembling Japanese karate). It is said to have first developed when the emperor Huangdi first employed it as a tool to train his armies in the Han dynasty. <br> <br>
      Styles of wushu are grouped by jia (family), sects, or schools, all united in having a foundation and taking inspiration from Chinese philosophy, religion, and folklore. The two main styles of wushu are internal and external. All styles of wushu can be categorized as either internal or external. Internal styles are forms of wushu practice that focus on qi manipulation; that is, styles that focus on the energy, mind, focus, and being of the practitioner. Styles that focus on physiological aspects of wushu practice, such as improvement of muscle and cardiovascular fitness, are external. An example of an internal wushu style is tai chi (which emphasizes controlling the flow of energy within the body) and an example of external practice is kung fu (which is focused on form, strength, balance, flexibility, and application in self defense). <br><br>
      Styles are also grouped by region (most commonly northern vs. southern). Close combat styles, for example, are primarily southern because residents of southern China were generally significantly shorter than residents of northern China and so two partners in combat had to physically stand much closer to each other in order to reach or punch the other. This is a true fact, even though it doesn&apos;t sound like it. <br><br>
      Another grouping of wushu styles is actually a major source of controversy in wushu practice: the conflict of traditionalists versus modernists. There exists a very divisive split amongst those who emphasize a Shaoling aesthetic (Shaolin monks&apos; practice representing the first institutionalized practice of Chinese martial arts) and modern practitioners. Modern practitioners often learn wushu for performance reasons (motivations very different from those of wushu&apos;s founders who were motivated by a desire for self protection and mental and physical health) and as a result, tend to believe that form work and purely aesthetic and performative flourishes are more relevant to the art of wushu than sparring and drill application emphasized by Shaolin styles. Generally speaking though, most styles&apos; perspectives view traditional forms practice within the traditional context (that is to say, as a vital component to 1. proper combat execution, 2. The Shaolin aesthetic as an art form, and 3. The meditative function of the physical art of wushu. 
      Another reason some people speculate performance techniques (which are more widespread in western countries than Shaolin techniques) often appear different than sparring applications is that older wushu teachers are purposefully concealing the actual functions and combat applications of techniques from outsiders, giving western practice a more aesthetic and visual drive and less of a combat or militant drive. <br><br>
      Modern styles of Chinese martial arts have developed that concentrate solely on forms, and do not practice application at all. These styles are aimed solely at exhibition and competition and include high, acrobatic jumps as well as forms that create pleasing visual spectacles of the human body- things traditional styles don&apos;t focus on. Many traditionalists consider the growing competitive nature of modern Chinese martial arts as overly westernized and commercialized and devoid of its traditional values. This de-traditionalization as a result of the globalization of the sport is a recurring source of conflict in the philosophies of practitioners today. It creates an interesting debate- some say wushu is too globalized and argue that the loss of technique is abundantly clear in newer styles. Others say that wushu isn&apos;t globalized at all- many wushu studios teach in Mandarin Chinese only and China&apos;s never struggled to maintain its spot as the global champion of the sport. <br><br>
      The politics of wushu from a historical standpoint bring even more complexity to wushu&apos;s cultural significance in China. Wushu is deeply rooted in the country&apos;s military history as it was used as an important tool in training ancient Chinese soldiers in combat while also emphasizing soldier&apos;s mindfulness, thought, and the virtue of practice over time. The ideals held by wushu practitioners evolved with Chinese society and were heavily informed by Confucian ideals. In fact, kung fu directly translates to “hard work”. Kung fu, like Confucian philosophy, emphasizes hard work and the practice and development of excellence over long periods of time. Upon the founding of the People&apos;s Republic of China, many martial arts masters fled the country, resulting in a massive dissemination of talent to Taiwan. Practice of traditional martial arts continued to be discouraged throughout the Chinese Cultural Revolution from 1969 to 1976 and the Era of Reconstruction, and the martial arts that survived was subject to radical transformation by the People&apos;s Republic of China to align them with Maoist revolutionary doctrine. The PRC promoted its own version, regulated by a government committee, as a replacement for more independent varieties of martial arts.  The primary purpose of regulating the sport and emphasizing a government controlled variation of wushu was to suppress what the government saw as the revolutionary and subversive potential of Chinese martial arts&apos; focus on self defense.  <br><br>
      There have been recent efforts to depoliticize wushu. Organizations that are still political, but less blatantly political, have created a standardized global scoring for the spot and recent years have seen a resurgence in the practice of traditional styles.<br><br>
      Practice today generally consists of: rudimentary technique and form practice, conditioning, meditation, qi training, and weapons training.

      <p class="hidden puppetry">
        Puppetry is an art over 3,000 years old with diverse cultural roots globally and great differentiated histories depending on the country of origin. Let&apos;s break it down:<br><br>

        <bold>Egpyt</bold> -  There's evidence that puppetry was used as early as 2000 BC in Egypt in the form of string operated wooden figures that could move their arms as if kneading bread. Figures made of clay and ivory, with join articulation and wire controls, have also been found in ancient Egyptian tombs. <br><br>

        <bold>Africa</bold> - Puppets play an important role in African ritual tradition. Puppetry continues to play a role both in a ceremonial context (hunting and healing ceremonies, for example) and also a historical context. Puppets ar used in storytelling, dance, and performance and are an important part of passing along cultural values and ideas among communities. <br><br>

        <bold>India</bold> - Some scholars believe that Sutradhara (or "the holder of strings"), the main character in many Sanskrit plays, was a puppeteer, providing evidence of puppetry's cultural significance dating back at least 4000 years.<br><br>

        <bold>Japan</bold> - Japanese Bunraku has origins in Shinto temple traditions, and has evolved into a highly sophisticated form of puppetry. Puppeteers dressed in all black disappeared into the black background of the stage as lanterns illuminated only the brightly painted wood puppets. <br><br>

        <bold>Southeast Asia</bold> - Javnese Wayang theater, or shadow puppet theater, was influenced in some ways by Indian puppetry tradition. Shadow puppets are elaborately carved with stone and bone into leather and wood, and are hand painted; each puppet often takes an artist two to three weeks to make from start to finish.<br><br>

        <bold>China</bold> -  Puppetry in China dates back at least 2000 years to "pi ying xi" or "theater of lantern shadows" (Chinese shadow theater). By the Song dynasty around 1000 AD, puppetry in China was considered an art form for all classes, including the royal courts, and was widely accepted and appreciated as a form of storytelling and a way to spread cultural ideas. In contrast, in Europe puppets continued to be seen as low class. <br><br>

        <bold>Italy</bold> -  Considered to be the home of the marionette, puppets were often used by the Church to put on morality plays. It is believed the word "marionette" comes from little figures of the Virgin Mary. <br><br>

        <bold>Britian</bold> - The famous Punch and Judy shows, featuring a trickster and his wife, were famously performing in transportable booths around England in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 20th century, the British Puppet and Model Theater Guild furthered the popularity of puppetry through the publication of literature and plays. <br><br>

        <bold>Contemporary Puppetry</bold> - During the 20th century, puppetry's development in parallel with the development of film, television, and other media greatly changed the course of its history. Puppeteers explored the new accessibility of their work and the widespread audiences they could reach, and puppetry became once more an art for an adult audience (puppeteers began exploring puppetry in experimental, high art contexts). Puppetry now is perhaps most knwon through film or television contexts but continues to play a vibrant role in live theater, where puppets are regularly used as props or characters. Digital puppetry and electronic puppets (animatronics) are also in widespread use from Hollywood movies to amusements parks.<br><br> 

        <bold>Muppets</bold> - The Muppets, created by Jim Henson, are a group of puppet characters whose self referential variety style absurdist comedy made contemporary puppetry more global and popular than any other modern puppet characters today. Their impact on puppetry is unparalleled in live theater, television, and film. Some believe that the globalization of Muppets, the influence they've had on other puppet forms, and prevelance of Muppets in pop culture is the reason some audienes associate puppets with absurd and childish humor. <br><br>
